> A Beautiful Journey to Writing Wise Code  
> 지혜로운 코드를 만들기 위한 아름다운 여정

- The structure of the source code should be as clear as **a table of contents in a book** to help understand the system.  
  소스 코드의 계층 구조는 시스템을 이해하기 위한 **책의 목차처럼** 명확해야 합니다.
  
- Test code should serve as **a manual** for understanding business rules.  
  테스트 코드는 비즈니스 규칙을 이해하는 **매뉴얼 역할을** 해야 합니다.

## Domain-Driven Design Basic

> This has been restructured based on "[Getting Started: Domain-Driven Design](https://dometrain.com/course/getting-started-domain-driven-design-ddd/?ref=dometrain-github&promo=getting-started-domain-driven-design)".

### Goal
- Understand code structuring for sustainable software development.
- Learn design patterns that express domain knowledge as code.

### Solution Design Principles

1. **Separation**
   - **Concern**: `Business Concern` vs `Technical Concern`
   - **Goal**: `Main Goal` vs `Sub-Goal`(something supplementary to the main goal, 부수 목표: 주가 되는 것에 붙어 따르는 것)
1. **Direction**
   - **Up**: The more important thing from a technical aspect(Sub-Goal)
   - **Down**: The more important thing from a business aspect(Main Goal)

<br/>

| `Direction`  | `Separation` of Concerns | `Separation` of Goals                         |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Up    | Technical Concern(Infinite)   | Sub-Goal(Infinite -Abstractions-> Finite)   |
| Down  | Business Concern(Finite)      | Main Goal(Finite)                           |

- To transform the infinite nature of sub-goals into a finite structure, an `Abstractions` top-level folder is introduced, with sub-goals placed in subfolders beneath it.
- This ensures a clear separation between sub-goals and the main goal, making all folders, except for the `Abstractions` folder at the top, more intuitively understood as part of the main goal."
